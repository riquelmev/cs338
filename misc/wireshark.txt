=====DAYTIME=====
1.
(i.e. the frame number 3, the source IP address, the destination IP address, the protocol, and the "Info" for the frame).

1 172.16.138.128 129.6.15.28 TCP SYN SEQ=0 Win=64240 Len=0
2 129.6.15.28 172.16.138.128 TCP SYN,ACK SEQ=0 ACK=1 Win=64240 Len=0
3 172.16.138.128 129.6.15.28 TCP ACK SEQ=1 ACK= 1 Win=64240 Len=0

2. Port 32828. The client needs a port as well since there are many connections on the my computer and the server needs to know where to send the packets.

5. SYN stands for synchronization packet. The protocol uses this packet in the 3-way handshake to initiate a connection.

6. ACK stands for acknowledgement packet. The protocol uses these packets to acknowledge that it has received a packet with a given sequence number.

7. A FIN Packet is used to terminate a connection. Both client and server send a FIN packet.

8. We see that the server initiated the termination since frame that has the first FIN packet has a source IP that corresponds with the server.

====HTTP=====

1.  I see 3 connections as I see 3 different SYN pair-interactions and 3 different client ports being used.

2. I see where the http index.html was requested on frame 4. I see the info contains the request GET /index.

3. I can see where the jpg was requested on frame 8. I see that the info column contains the request GET jeff_square_head.jpg


======Questions======
1. Why are there multiple connections opened over a seemingly very simple connection 
and request?

2. What does the TCP keep-alive request mean. Is there an auto-shut off if no packet is received in a certain amount of time?

3. Why is there a length field and a Len in the info as well? They seem to differ in size as well.
